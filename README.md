# COVID-19 Time Series Analysis
This project is one of my machine learning and data-driven web apps made using Python and Streamlit. The goal of this project is to visualize the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries from COVID-19. View this app in action [here](https://covid19-time-series.herokuapp.com)

## Demo
Here's a quick demo on how to use the app,

## About the Dataset
The COVID-19 dataset was published by [John Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)
, which consist of daily level information on the number of affected cases,
deaths and recovery. Note that this is a time series data so the number of cases on any given day is the cumulative number.
The time series data used in this dataset is between 22 January 2020 and 22 June 2020. More details about the dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset?select=time_series_covid_19_recovered.csv)
